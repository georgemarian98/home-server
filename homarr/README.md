# Homarr

This is a dashboard page.
I configured to have ease access to the hosted services and also to replace the Chrome bookmarks that I have.
I had to use `New Tab Redirect` extension on Chrome for new tabs to be redirected to Homarr page.
It has cool integrations with pihole,  OMV(doesn't work), Jellyfin and many more.

I used the docker compose file from [here](https://homarr.dev/docs/integrations/containers/).
Usefull documentation about [integrations](https://homarr.dev/docs/category/integrations).
