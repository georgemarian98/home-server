# Jellyseerr

Jellyseerr is a service for managing requests for your media library. It integrates with Sonarr and Radarr.
You request something through Jellyseerr and it will send that media request download to sonarr or radarr. 
Basically it merges the two functionalities together and it has pretty cool media discovery.
